                                <p class="my-3">I joined the UofT robotics association relatively recently and placed on their autonomous rover team due to their need of ROS developers. This team competes in the IGVC competition annually. A competition where an autonomous rover must complete a set track while avoiding obstacles. When I first joined I noticed the development environment wasn't containerised so I used my experience with docker to create development &amp; production images. This standardised everyone's environments &amp; made testing / tracking different packages easier. Later and to date I've been testing different nav packages &amp; seeing their effect on on the rover's ability to complete goal setting &amp; ultimately complete the track. I would say the most valuable technical knowledge I'm developing in my time at UTRA is working with simulations / Gazebo.</p>

                                <p class="my-3">I did my capstone with 2 teammates: an AI powered pdf reader / chat bot. When I was considering what project I wanted to do for my capstone I wanted to work on something in robotics/automation, or AI (or both). I'm particularly interested in the educational aspects of AI which is what ultimately led me to selecting this project. We followed a similar system architecture to the diagram provided, but we added an algorithm layer to select the most relevant / best "chunk" of text from a pdf given a user query rather than simply using a greedy approach. We also added a data cleaning layer to format things like tables. Another difference is we didn't use pinecone for our vector database. Our code is in python with the exception of the UI done in react. A simple flask server receives HTTP requests &amp; communication with the model is facilitated by langchain. The most difficult / frustrating part of this capstone is easily trying to come up with meaningful metrics to evaluate performance.</p><a href="https://github.com/AliAboelela123/FinancialDocumentAIAnalyzer" class="fab fa-github-square" style="font-size:30px;margin:2px;padding:2px;color:var(--bs-body-bg);"></a>

                                <p class="my-3">This was a quick project I did recently to take care of my plants that were always struggling with water. I could never tell if my plant needed to be watered unless the dirt was extremely dry, but I didn't want it to get to that point. I also wanted to do a more hands on project since most of my previous work is purely software. I connected an arduino to a moisture sensor, and used the readings to control a relay which used a battery to power a 5V pump that would water the plant. At first I considered using a raspi but the moisture sensor I bought provides analog readings and I didn't want to buy a shield for the raspi which normally only accepts digital readings. Despite its simplicity this was actually one of the more fun projects I worked on.</p><a href="https://github.com/AliAboelela123/EasyPlants" class="fab fa-github-square" style="font-size:30px;margin:2px;padding:2px;color:var(--bs-body-bg);"></a>

                                <p class="my-3">This was a social media app I worked on in a group of 5. I was quite disconnected from the front end of the app due to a well rounded team. My responsibilities were to setup the database (firebase) &amp; our GCP account so we could use firebase auth. I also worked on part of the server API (written in flask). Due to the larger scope of the project more energy was spent in the requirements planning which was a good exercise.</p><a href="https://github.com/ECE444-2023Fall/project-1-web-application-design-group3-bugbusters" class="fab fa-github-square" style="font-size:30px;margin:2px;padding:2px;color:var(--bs-body-bg);"></a>

                                <p class="my-3">This project was a collaborative effort from my 2 partners and I. There were 3 main components to building our GIS. We used the OpenStreetMap API to collect geographic inforamtion which was organized as a graph of intersections (nodes) and streets (edges). The GTK library was used to render graphics, and finally features such as pathfinding were implemented using Djkstra's algorithm. This project was significantly larger in scope than anything else I had ever done. I view my success in this project as one of the key milestones which gave me confidence in my ability to work with C++ when I was first learning the language in 2nd year. The GIS was tested on many cities such as Tehran, Cairo, New Delhi, Tokyo, NYC. Given the size of the data that was being mapped, this was the first time I had to seriously consider the complexity of graph operations we wanted to perform for whatever feature; lest we suffer the consequence of an unresponsive and unpleasent experience.</p><a href="https://github.com/AliAboelela123/UofT-ECE297-GIS" class="fab fa-github-square" style="font-size:30px;margin:2px;padding:2px;color:var(--bs-body-bg);"></a>

                                <p class="my-3">This was a project I did in a 3rd year intro to AI course. I wrote a simple script to train a classifier to recognise ASL. The script itself was very easy to write; it was done in a few lines of pytorch. The most interesting / enjoyable part of this project was generating / collecting data. The class collectively created a dataset: everyone was to provide picture of the different hand gestures for ASL from different angles and in agreed upon dimensions. The picture to the left shows me doing the sign for "A".</p>

The first project was a simple processor written as a FSM in Verilog. The second, more enjoyable part was a simple intro to embedded development. By writing to specific addresses in memory the VGA display of the board could be changed.
